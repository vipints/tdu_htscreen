## this will be the single point of contact for tracking the setup of experiment
## This serve as the source of the experiment start 
 
stock_name = "Kinase"

## The above provided name will be a primary name of the screen 
## Now program need a path to look for the generated folders and files

experiment_path = "/Users/vipin/Documents/tdu_screens/"

## From here on, program aims to search multiple folders to scan intermediate files
## Based on the above mentioned stock name, it will generate the first mapping to the 
## target. From there it will look for the remaining associations. 
## TODO When do the program stop searching for the next association.

## When the program finds a csv it needs to be read
## the module for that here:

	load full data from the experiment step in a dataframe.

	exp_df = exp_details.fillna(value=0)

	print exp_df.iloc[:,[1,4]]
	## search for the name SourceBarcode and DestinationBarcode from the dataframe selected columns
